	test untested primitives
	add missing primitives

VM:	run time code for do, loop, +loop, leave

	add debug flag for conditionally turning on/off writing execution trace to file

	think about console i/o.
	change output to write to (temp) file, watched by Automate, and read/update by a
	terminal screen emulating widget. Same mechanism could possible be used for console input.

compile:
	several words per line

	replace /mod and */ primitives against */mod, int the q

	derive mod / /mod */ from */mod

	ok: add a translation layer between names of directives and their corresponding functions
	ok: with above, add host words for functions with currently impossible names, like ; ! - * /

	more clearly dedicate one name space to host only ("exec") words, the other to compile 
	time words ("comp").

	en route: Eliminate the pseudo-"immediate" host words, by defining twice with different execution semantics.
