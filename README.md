# FlowForth
Another curious Forth alike interpreter, running on flow charts as host computer

FlowForth runs on a flow charts interpreter, specifically on Automate, which is an automation app for Android devices.  
Currently does the VM look like this:

Flow starting points are on the left. One for manually launching the VM, with a file selector popping up.  
The other starting point monitors a file, and is triggered when that file is written to. From that file is  
the program file read, loaded into (emulated) memory, and a cold start performed, which leads to the  
VM "next" routine, the core of the emulator (lower left). The bulk of remaining blocks are used for primitives  
implementation.  

Programs written as far are exclusively test routines.  A failing test lights the device LED in red.  
The LED turning green indicates a successfully accomplished test.

Trace files are generated by the VM, which are currently about the only diagnostics (apart from a colourful LED),  
as there is no console I/O yet.  Closest thing to outputting a number (.) is drop, which writes the dropped  
value into the trace file, for later inspection. I consider writing emails for input, and receiving those for output.  

The VM is no performance monster, but seems quick enough to attempt porting a complete interpreter to it.  

Currently are programs for the VM cross compiled on a host computer, and compiler output copied to the device  
over the air, using rsync.  The compiler has been written in bash.

This github repository is mostly suited for the file based components (programs, library, compiler, support scripts).  
For the VM, the [Automate forum](https://llamalab.com/automate/community/flows/37943) is likely a better place, as it provides a preview possibility.  

This project is in a very alpha state, in fact, it's hardly useful at this point, though it's hard to speak of  
"useful" with such a project. It's fun though, trying to run Forth on another rather unlikely platform.  

Goal and purpose of the Flowforth VM was to give me a kickstart into the Automate tool: As former Automagic (a similar  
automation app which isn't maintained any longer) user I needed an alternative, and get familiar with it quickly.
